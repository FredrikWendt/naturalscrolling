Natural Scrolling for Linux

Natural Scrolling adds a menu bar item allowing the direction of scrolling to be toggled.

Use Natural Scrolling to reverse the direction of scrolling on your Linux.
With Natural Scrolling, you push your fingers upwards to move the page content upwards (and downwards for downwards) just like on iOS devices.
