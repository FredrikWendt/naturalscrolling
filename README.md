# Natural Scrolling for Linux

## Natural Scrolling adds a menu bar item allowing the direction of scrolling to be toggled.

Use Natural Scrolling to reverse the direction of scrolling on your Linux.  

With Natural Scrolling, you push your fingers upwards to move the page content upwards (and downwards for downwards) just like on iOS devices.  
Don't move scrollbars anymore but your file.

## Install
‘Natural Scrolling’ can be installed in Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10 from its own PPA

Add ‘ppa:zedtux/naturalscrolling‘ to your Software Sources, update, then install the ‘naturalscrolling’ package from the Ubuntu Software Centre.

Launch the applet using the Dash, and toggle Natural Scrolling using the Application Indicator present in the top panel. 
When Natural Scrolling is active a small ‘tick’ will be shown. Click again to disable it.

## Ubuntu
